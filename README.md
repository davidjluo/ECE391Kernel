# ECE391Kernel
A functional, built from scratch, linux kernel replica. 
Developed at UIUC for the course ECE391, with Ryan Mikes, Het Patel, and Misha Patel.

OS has a fully functional file system, communicates with various devices, mimics linux commands (ls, grep, cat, etc),
supports multiple terminals, and has scheduling implemented.

Due to academic integrity reasons, code cannot be made public on GitHub. If you'd like to get in touch and potentially
look over code/see a demo, please email at 'DAVIDJLUO.98@gmail.com' with the subject heading: '391 KERNEL'.
